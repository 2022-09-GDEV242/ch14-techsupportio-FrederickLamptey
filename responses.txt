crash,crashes
                        Well, it never crashes on our system. It must have something
                        to do with your system. Tell me more about your configuration.

slow
                        I this is a hardware problem. Upgrading your processor 
                        should solve all performance problems. Do you ever get a problem with 
                        our software?

performance 
                        Performance was quite adequate in all our tests. Are you running 
                        any other processes in the background?

bug 
                        Well, you know, all software has some bugs. But our software engineers 
                        are working very hard to fix them. Can you describe the problem a little 
                        further?

buggy 
                        Well, you know, all software has some bugs. But our software engineers 
                        are working very hard to fix them. Can you describe the problem a bit 
                        further?

windows 
                        This is a known bug to do with the Windows operating system. Please 
                        report it to Microsoft. We wish we could help with that.

macintosh 
                        This is a known bug to do with the Mac operating system. Please 
                        report it to Apple. There is nothing we can do about this.

expensive 
                        The cost of our product is quite competitive. Have you looked around 
                        and really compared our features?

installation 
                        The installation is really quite straight forward. We have tons of 
                        wizards that do all the work for you. Have you read the installation 
                        instructions?

memory 
                        If you read the system requirements carefully, you will see that the 
                        specified memory requirements are 3 giga byte. You should 
                        upgrade your memory. Anything else you want to know?

linux 
                        We take Linux support very seriously. But there are some problems. 
                        Most have to do with incompatible versions. Can you be a bit 
                        more precise?

bluej 
                        It's a development environment that allows you to develop Java programs. And yeah
                        it has a book to aid in understanding object oriented programming better in java. Try
                        it out.
